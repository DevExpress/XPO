  - [Data Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid)
  - [Data Layout Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/4921/controls-and-libraries/form-layout-managers/layout-and-data-layout-controls/data-layout-control)
  - [Editors](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/4712/controls-and-libraries/editors-and-simple-controls/simple-editors/product-information/editors)
  - [Server Mode Collections](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/8398/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/data-binding/large-data-sources-server-and-instant-feedback-modes).

>The instructions include only C# code snippets. For the complete C# and VB code, see the CS and VB sub-directories.  


## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017 or 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
* [Unified Installer for .NET and HTML5 Developers](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/Try/).
* We recommend that you select all the DevExpress products when you run the installation. It will register local NuGet package sources, item and project templates required for these tutorials. You can uninstall unnecessary components later.
* Basic C# (VB.NET) and WinForms knowledge. If you are new to WinForms, please use Microsoft tutorials to get started:
