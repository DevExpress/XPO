# DevExpress XPO for .NET Core / .NET Standard 2.0 Demos

This repository contains demo projects demonstrating how to use [eXpressPersistent Objects™ (XPO)](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/)  in [\.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) applications. You can use these projects to learn how to use XPO in console, ASP.NET Core or Xamarin applications. All required DevExpress references are included.

## Console Demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos)

The solution located in the `XpoConsoleCoreDemo` subfolder is a **.NET Standard 2.0** console application, demonstrating how to initialize the data layer and perform basic data operations. To run the application, execute the following commands in the **repository root folder** (XpoNetCoreDemos by default):

```
cd XpoConsoleCoreDemo\XpoConsoleCoreDemo
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The project is configured to use a local **SQLite** database. You can modify the code in the *Program.cs* file to configure another database connection (e.g., **MS SQL Server** or [any other supported database](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/2114/DevExpress-ORM-Tool/Fundamentals/Database-Systems-Supported-by-XPO)).

## ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos)

The solution located in the `XpoASPNETCoreDemo` subfolder is a **.NET Standard 2.0** console application that displays a simple view with basic operations (*create*, *delete*, *list*). To run the application, execute the following commands in the repository root folder:

```
cd XpoASPNETCoreDemo\DevExpress.Xpo.AspNetCoreDemo
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Then, open http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

The project is configured for a local **SQLite** database. Modify the *Startup.cs* and *appsettings.json* files to configure another database connection (e.g., **MS SQL Server** or [any other supported database](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/2114/DevExpress-ORM-Tool/Fundamentals/Database-Systems-Supported-by-XPO)). Check out the [ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection in XPO](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T637597/asp-net-core-dependency-injection-in-xpo) help topic for more information. 

## ASP.NET Core MVC Demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevExpress/XpoNetCoreDemos)

The solution located in the `XpoASPNETCoreMVCDemo` subfolder is a **.NET Standard 2.0** console application that displays a simple view with basic operations (*create*, *delete*, *list*). To run the application, execute the following commands in the repository root folder:

```
cd XpoASPNETCoreMVCDemo\DevExpress.Xpo.AspNetCoreMVCDemo
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Then, open http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

The project is configured for a local **SQLite** database. Modify the *Startup.cs* and *appsettings.json* files to configure another database connection (e.g., **MS SQL Server** or [any other supported database](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/2114/DevExpress-ORM-Tool/Fundamentals/Database-Systems-Supported-by-XPO)). Check out the [ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection in XPO](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T637597/asp-net-core-dependency-injection-in-xpo) help topic for more information.


## Xamarin Demo

The solution located in the `XpoXamarinFormsDemo` subfolder demonstrates the use of XPO in [Xamarin\.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms). It contains the following projects:
 - *DevExpress.Xpo.XamarinFormsDemo.UI* - the common .NET Standard 2.0 project with business logic (data layer initialization, data manipulation) and page layouts;
 - *DevExpress.Xpo.XamarinFormsDemo.Android* [![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/6437f2e5-5b4f-44f5-925c-e8a8df334afa/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)  - Android app project;
 - *DevExpress.Xpo.XamarinFormsDemo.iOS* [![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/235d5dbc-83bf-42d5-9e48-52dd8770d5bf/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms) - iOS app project;
 - *DevExpress.Xpo.XamarinFormsDemo.UWP* - UWP app project.

To try this demo, open the solution in [Visual Studio 2017 for Windows 15.6.0](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#15.4) or [Visual Studio 2017 for Mac 7.4.0](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes) or a newer version. In order to use [.NET Standard 2.0 in UWP](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/10/10/announcing-uwp-support-for-net-standard-2-0/), you need to target "Windows 10 Fall Creators Update" as the minimum version of your UWP project.

The demo is configured to use the in-memory data provider with XML storage. Modify the *App.xaml.cs* file in the *DevExpress.Xpo.XamarinFormsDemo.UI* project to configure another database connection (e.g., **SQLite**, **MS SQL Server** or [any other supported database](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/2114/DevExpress-ORM-Tool/Fundamentals/Database-Systems-Supported-by-XPO)).

## ORM Benchmark

The solution located in the `ORMBenchmark` subfolder is a benchmark that you can use to test XPO against [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) and [Entity Framework 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/). You can view the benchmark results at [ORMBenchmark/README.md](ORMBenchmark/README.md).
